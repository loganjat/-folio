<p>I seek to create things that made life better, things that make a difference. I started by studying Industrial Design, then shifted into applied 
research--learning methods to understand and evaluate intractable problems like poverty and education inequity. Interviewing and stakeholder mapping in East Palo Alto led to recommendations for investments. Ethnography in rural Mexico led
to deep insights and plan of action for an organization.</p> 
<p>A bias for action led me to consulting where I researched, concepted and built solutions to improve lives for people in poverty. That same bias for action led me to the classroom where I built a pipeline into magnet schools and future
opportunity for a community with growing prospects.</p>
<p>User experience research is where I can combine research methods and a bias for action to deliver on my goal to make things that make a difference.</p>
