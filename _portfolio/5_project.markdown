	Choice Humanitarian-Mexico: Ethnographic Evaluation 
</div>


Problem

Choice Humanitarian is a capacity building organization that seeks to develop skills and leadership in the villages it supports. Two of their supported villages in rural Mexico had been recieving support through a goat loan program for over 8 years. An infusion of $250,000.00 (USD) via a grant sought by villagers to build goat cheese factories brought increased scrutiny and concern for the villages dependency on Choice and it's regional leadership. My team of 3 ethnographic evaluators was tasked with determining the greatest factors in its dependency and potential for future self-sustainability.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
