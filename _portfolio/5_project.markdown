	Choice Humanitarian-Mexico: Ethnographic Evaluation 
</div>


Problem

Choice Humanitarian is a capacity building organization that seeks to develop skills and leadership in the villages it supports. Two of their supported villages in rural Mexico had been recieving support through a goat loan program for over 8 years. An infusion of $250,000.00 (USD) via a grant sought by villagers to build goat cheese factories brought increased scrutiny and concern for the villages dependency on Choice and it's regional leadership. My team of 3 ethnographic evaluators was tasked with determining the greatest factors in its dependency and potential for future self-sustainability.

We began our research with semi-structured interviews administered to one representative of available homes in each community (~30 total). Because the regional leader was wary of our involvement, we used our initial contact with villagers to build rapport with the overall community and learn of the overall impact of the goat cheese businesses. We alsoÂ interviewed the participants of the program with a set inventory on leadership, business, and culture, as well as questions from the sponsoring organizations evaluation framework. By living in the communities during the week we were able to build strong relationships, observe business operations and gain the confidence of the villagers and regional leader who was pleased by our holistic approach. 
To validate themes emerging from interview synthesis, we formed focus groups and led participatory research sessions to elicit responses to our identified factors and gain rich insight into village dynamics, operations and mindsets.

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
