	Venture Philanthropy: Concepting and Designing a Service
</div>


Problem

As a research consultant at a management consulting group I was tasked with the proposing a plan for an investor interested in an alternative to donations. 

Method

I performed a literature review on social enterprise and venture development. I then recruited and interview subject matter experts using semi-structured interviews to catalog approaches to social business. I worked with internal groups as advisors to build out plans and # of interviews with people across the world (countries) worked to pair interests fo of investor in bolstering economies in developing nations. 


Result

	  <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/conceptstool.png" alt="" title="Concepts Tool"/>
	</div>

	The tools I was responsible for switched from pages--where information was difficult and tedious to recover--to accordians with relevant and descriptive labels (LEFT), and persistent sidebars to easily move from subconcept to concept (RIGHT).
