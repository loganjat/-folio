</div>


Method

Research begun with a literature review on social enterprise and venture development. I then recruited and interviewed subject matter experts using semi-structured interviews to catalog successes and failures in approaches to social enterprise. I then built scripts and worked with my manager and a small team to interview potential stakeholders on-site, and survey potential business participants in developing nations. With my team I concepted various service designs and tested concepts with stakeholders in sites of interest to the investor.
