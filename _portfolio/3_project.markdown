title: Evaluative Research

Problem

In my role as Researcher at Prudential and PowerSchool the burden of concept validation, usability and customer feedback sense making rested with product managers. In each case I was hired to build on a newly adopted research initiative and establish a deeper understanding of current and developing product utility.

Method

Through user testing, lab moderated testing or unmoderated testing via online tools, I provided timely research insights with behavioral evidence from user participants in the form of video, audio or images. 


Result

Product teams incorporated evaluative research in the product development lifecycle. In general research started occurring in earlier stages of product lifecytle and across a greater number of products. Overall many findings were incorporated to improve product utility, and promote further generative and exploratory testing.
