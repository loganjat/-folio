title: Evaluative Research

Problem

At PowerSchool the burden of concept validation, usability and customer feedback sense making rested with product managers. I was hired to build a research process and establish a deeper understanding of our customers and utility of current and developing products. 


Method

I provided timely research insights with behavioral evidence from user participants in the form of video, audio or images. 


Result

Evalutive research was performed across a greater number of products and findings were incorporated to improve product utility, and promote further generative and exploratory testing.
