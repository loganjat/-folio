Problem

In my roles as Researcher at Prudential and PowerSchool the burden of concept validation, usability and customer feedback sense making rested with product managers. In each case I was hired to build on a newly adopted research initiative and establish a deeper understanding of current and developing product utility.

	  <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/prulab.png" alt="" title="lab"/>
	</div>

Method

By conducting lab moderated testing and unmoderated testing I provided timely research insights with behavioral evidence from user participants in the form of video, audio or images. 


Result

Evalutive research was performed across a greater number of products and findings were incorporated to improve product utility, and promote further generative and exploratory testing.
