Problem

A product team wanted to release an engaging mobile learning game that would encourage 

<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/school.jpg" alt="" title="affinity diagramming"/>
	  <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kids.jpg" alt="" title="prototypes"/>
	</div>


Method

I established and tested an engagement metric to establish a baseline and goal. 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/theme.png" alt="themes" title="themes"/>
</div>

Result

We presented the research and concept validation performed and communicated PowerSchool's opportunity to deliver a much needed experience for teachers and administrators. The product was prioritized for development set to be available at the subsequent platform release. Impressed with the research and design method, executives proposed that all future products follow a similar process.
