	Engagement Score
</div>


Problem

A product team wanted to understand which features were needed to build an engaging mobile learning game. 

<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/school.jpg" alt="" title="in-person feedback"/>
	  <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/example@2x.png" alt="" title="SUS"/>
	</div>


Method

I implemented a system usability scale and built an engagement instrument to establish a baseline score for each. I worked with the product team to set a goal SUS and engagement score and phases for desired incremental improvements. After several experiments recruiting our target demographic we identified a good process with a healthy response rate and low cost. I started testing game builds in phases using combination of remote unmoderated and in-person moderated testing. I introduced the Kano model to identify priority game features ranked by importance.


Result

Incremental testing guided by benchmarks allowed the team to dedicate resources to critical core elements, and focus remaining time to develop desired gamified features.
