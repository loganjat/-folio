Problem

PowerSchool built a unified classroom to be a one-stop platform for teachers, students, parents and schools. After core features were built into the platform, PowerSchool wanted to determine what features to add.

	  <img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/card1.png" alt="" title="Concepts Tool"/>
	</div>


Method

I worked with a product manager to understand latent needs around specific tasks and processes in the classroom and central district offices. Starting with observations gleaned from semi-structured interviews with teachers and district administrators we synthesized insights and identified themes for teacher and administrator needs. Because the eventual product would integrate with several other products within the unified platform we involved various internal stakeholders in participatory design. In these sessions we presented various problems based on discovered themes, and wireframed and promoted components of these designs based on feedback from group members and platform constraints. We validated early designs with teachers and district administrators through usability tests.

</div>

Result

We presented the research and concept validation performed and communicated PowerSchool's opportunity to deliver a much needed experience for teachers and administrators. The product was prioritized for development set to be available at the subsequent platform release. Impressed with the research and design method, executives proposed that all future products follow a similar process.
